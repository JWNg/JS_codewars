This will probably be a little serie :)

X-Shape

You will get an odd Integer n (>= 3) and your task is to draw a X. Each line is seperated with '\n'.

Use the following characters:

■ □

e.g.:


                                     ■□□□■
            ■□■                      □■□■□
  x(3) =>   □■□              x(5)=>  □□■□□
            ■□■                      □■□■□
                                     ■□□□■
