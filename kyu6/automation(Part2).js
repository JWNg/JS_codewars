Preamble:

You were cleaning your virtual pantry and accidentally found a folder with a label on it: "Automaton v1.9".
Part 2:

After you're done with cleaning you noticed Manual.txt right next to Automaton's folder.
Manual for Automaton v1.9:

- If automaton accepts "string" it will tell you the amount of vowels that string contains.
Example:

automaton("String") // 1
- If automaton accepts "number" it will tell you if this is a prime number. Example:
Example:

automaton(3); // true
automaton(3.5); // false
automaton(4); // false
- If automaton accepts "object" it will give you another object with swapped keys / values
Example:

automaton({"a": "b"}); // {"b": "a"}
automaton([1, 0]); // {"0": "1", "1": "0"}
automaton([]); // []
You checked the results that Automaton gave you and saw that the data was inaccurate. So you decided to fix it.
