//Description:
//
//The accounts of the "Fat to Fit Club (FFC)" association are supervised by John as a volunteered accountant. The association is funded through financial donations from generous benefactors. John has a list of the first n donations: [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] He wants to know how much the next benefactor should give to the association so that the average of the first n + 1 donations should reach an average of 30. After doing the math he found 149. He thinks that he made a mistake. Could you help him?
//
//if dons = [14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15] then new_avg(dons, 30) --> 149
//
//The function new_avg(arr, navg) should return the expected donation (rounded up to the next integer) that will permit to reach the average navg. Should the last donation be a non positive number (<= 0) John wants us to throw an error (return Nothing in Haskell) so that he clearly sees that his expectations are not great enough.
//
//Notes:
//
//all donations are numbers, arr can be empty.
//See examples below to see which error is to be thrown.
//new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 92) should return 645
//new_avg([14, 30, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15], 2) should raise an error (ValueError or invalid_argument)
